\title{$p$-adic Cohomology Theories}
\author{Chen Qiyuan\footnote{陈起渊，清华大学数学系数 80 班.}}

\begin{abstract}
    In this article, we define two $p$-adic cohomology theories:
    crystalline cohomology and rigid cohomology as such kinds of de Rham cohomology 
    and prove their desired properties as Weil cohomology theories, 
    such as finiteness, K\"unneth formula and Poincar\'e duality. 
    We shall prove the Katz conjecture as an application of $p$-adic cohomology theories.
