\begin{abstract}
	This article is about a problem in daily life: 
	KFC and McDonald's both want to open $n$ restaurants in a city. 
	McDonald's opens its restaurant first, 
	KFC opens its restaurants based on locations of McDonald's. 
	If everyone goes to the nearest restaurant, 
	could McDonald's make sure that it has at least half of the customers?
